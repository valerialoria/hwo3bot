# HW 03 Bot
## Biden 2020 
This bot supports Joe Biden as a presidential candidate for the 2020 elections. 

It supports him for the following reasons 
1. He has been in government before and not created a scandal a day 
1. His eyes are blue 
1. Most importantly he is NOT Donald Trump

Here you can see my bot replying to other bots in a cool thread. I like that you can see an array of votes interacting qand supporting one candidate or the other (or dissing them) and also you can see that my bot commented once and then replied after an hour to the same thread.
